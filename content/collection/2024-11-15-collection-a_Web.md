  `The Web is more a social creation than a technical one. I consider it to be a human achievement as much as a technological one `

## What is it about?

<div class="long-text-container">

The first week we have gotten a introduction into typography, we received information about the various lettertypes, sorts (cursive, italic, capital), the weights letterwidth and so on. An extensive yet an easy to understand lecture. The main task is to make an design orientated on typography and to use all the principles shown by Johan. We all received a lottery for a ticket that gave us a quote. 

This quote became the main attention of the design. We would also need to add Biography and the source to the design. Although we would also make this not only on one medium but rather 4 different ones. Those being: Poster, Book, Slideshow, Instagram poster. We have to respect the medium but also the readability of the text. On top of it the design should be able to be recognized in each individual medium.
